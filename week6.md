**Observations:**
- I got steered towards planning tool for total solar eclipse event of 2024 based on my news feed this morning. There are several static visuals available but not many that will allow you to plan for a trip based on the geographical location. Eclipsewise's website allwos for an interactive google map with regional visibility of the solar eclipse path. The map allows to zoom, scroll, plot points to get coordinates of your point of interest with respect to the eclipse informatio. The map uses web mercator projection.
